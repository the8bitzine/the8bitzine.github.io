We admire programmers who write in low-level languages, and sometimes we see a bit of superhuman in them. Often, beginner (and even advanced) programmers are concerned about assembly languages. This also applies to me. I was never interested in programming 8-bit computers because I thought that BASIC was quite limited, and the 6502 assembly was a field completely beyond my intellectual abilities.</description></item><item><title>Goddes of Fuji – Numen for an 8-bit Atari</title><link>https://the8bitzine.github.io/2021/09/goddes-of-fuji-numen-for-an-8-bit-atari/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 13:55:27 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://the8bitzine.github.io/2021/09/goddes-of-fuji-numen-for-an-8-bit-atari/</guid><description>Numen by Taquart! That’s a perfect topic for the first article. Numen (Latin word for goddes) debuted in 2002 at Polish demoparty „Lato ludzików”, it took first place in demo compo. Earliest and most technologically advanced part of this demo was made already in 1997 (authors called it „Turbo vectys” and it presents 3D blocks in last part).
But what it actually is? Imagine if Atari could run Doom – surrealistic, psychedelic version of Doom.</description></item></channel></rss>
