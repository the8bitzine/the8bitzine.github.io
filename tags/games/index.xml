crowds chant &amp;ldquo;go away&amp;rdquo;
If I were a dictator, I would take everything valuable and run away. This is exactly what you need to do in the game Overthrown for the Commodore VIC-20.
Some of us remember the times when eight-bit computers were every teenager&amp;rsquo;s dream. Slightly younger ones may remember the classic versions of GTA games, those with simple graphics and a top-down view. Later, 3D graphics almost completely dominated the gaming world.</description></item><item><title>Transarctica - ice cold train combat</title><link>https://the8bitzine.github.io/2021/09/transarctica-ice-cold-train-combat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:55:10 +3000</pubDate><guid>https://the8bitzine.github.io/2021/09/transarctica-ice-cold-train-combat/</guid><description>The world has come to an end, the sun is gone, the earth has turned into an ice desert. In an attempt to save the world from the Greenhouse effect, scientists detonated nuclear charges at both poles of the planet.
