Many consider it to be the best game ever made for eight-bit computers. I think I agree with that. One of the game&amp;rsquo;s breakthroughs is the availability of multi-player for up to four players.
We start with choosing a colour. The computer displays the next colours, the player can reserve a colour for himself by pressing the fire-button. Then we go to the choice of one of eight available races: Mechtron, Bonzoid, Flapper, Gollumer, Leggite, Packer, Spheroid or Humanoid.</description></item><item><title>Transarctica - ice cold train combat</title><link>https://the8bitzine.github.io/2021/09/transarctica-ice-cold-train-combat/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:55:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://the8bitzine.github.io/2021/09/transarctica-ice-cold-train-combat/</guid><description>The world has come to an end, the sun is gone, the earth has turned into an ice desert. In an attempt to save the world from the Greenhouse effect, scientists detonated nuclear charges at both poles of the planet. By doing so, they created a vapour layer in the atmosphere that, instead of cooling the planet down, led to eternal winter. The nightmare of scientists and environmentalists has become a fact.</description></item></channel></rss>
