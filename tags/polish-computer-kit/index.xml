This avant-garde of eight-bit computing seemed primitive compared to popular home computers. However, it was little known computers such as the Sinclair MK-14 that inspired the first bedroom-coders. This post however is about a different computer, unknown on the West, forgotten on the East - MIK CA80, early Polish mikrocomputer.
The history of modern PCs begins in 1970 when an Italian engineer, Federico Faggin, becomes an employee of Intel.</description></item><item><title>OREL BK-08 - a better speccy from Ukraine</title><link>https://the8bitzine.github.io/1/01/orel-bk-08-a-better-speccy-from-ukraine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://the8bitzine.github.io/1/01/orel-bk-08-a-better-speccy-from-ukraine/</guid><description>In the 1980s, citizens of Central and Eastern Europe did not have access to computers.
