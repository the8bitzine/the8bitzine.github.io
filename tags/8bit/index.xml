crowds chant &amp;ldquo;go away&amp;rdquo;
If I were a dictator, I would take everything valuable and run away. This is exactly what you need to do in the game Overthrown for the Commodore VIC-20.
Some of us remember the times when eight-bit computers were every teenager&amp;rsquo;s dream. Slightly younger ones may remember the classic versions of GTA games, those with simple graphics and a top-down view. Later, 3D graphics almost completely dominated the gaming world.</description></item></channel></rss>
